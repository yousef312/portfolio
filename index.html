        <h1>Yousef Neji</h1>
        <p>
            The art for me is life... <br>
            And it circle through every living and solid thing in our world... <br>
            The job is an other type of art, to program for me was a feeling of happiness!
        </p>

        <h3>I design</h3>
        <p>
            I always loved designing website, well I am not the best yet you may rate me well. <br>
            For me, I focused basically on the frontend develoment, And I only give a little for
            the backend. <br> 
            Maybe because I paint good I just had this artistic view over things! And this passion
            that push me to fix any little mistakes. <br>
            <br>
            I always count on myself to draw my apps icons and backgrounds.. Kind a have this self-belief!! <br>
        </p>

        <h3>I program</h3>
        <p>
            Besides Web development since it's mostly designing, I learned python, ruby nodeJs and some arabic
            programming language which where new at the time I knew them, such as Alif. <br>

            I just was interested in any thing new about programming, And trying all the different languages with their different syntaxes! 
        </p>

        <h3>I write</h3>
        <p>
            Writing is real amazing as it allows you to fly a bit out of usual, to figure some point of your personaltiy
            and discover a lot of new points of views for real. <br> <br>
            I started writing since I was 10 years old, and I kept so untill I become 15 years old where my mind started to get
            lost with a lot of different other stuffs. Then, I had this passion again as I discovered the english language <br>
            There I started to talk in english very well, And I take my writing skills a step forward! <br>
            And because I was good in painting too, I make this blend of writing and painting to draw my first 
            cartoonic story when I was 13 year old. <br>

        </p>
        <h3>I dance, sing and play piano a bit...</h3>
        <p>
            Yeah and I do this couples of stuffs! <br>
            also beatboxing!!
        </p>
